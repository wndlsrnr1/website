You are right.
Relying solely on client-side storage like localStorage for determining user roles is insecure beacause manipulate it and gain unauthorized access
to restricted parts of your application. to prevent this, it's crucial to implement robust server-side checks and
minimize trust in client-side data for security decisions.

Secure Implementation for Admin Routes in React

To properly scure you application, you need to

1. Authenticate and autorize users on the server-side: Always enforce security rules on the server to protect sensitive data.
2. Use server-validated information in you React app: Ensure your React app only shows admin content if the server confirms the user's role.

Here's how to enhance security in you React application.

Get User Role from the Server
Instead of storing user role directly in 'localStorage' and relying on it for access control,
fetch the user's role from a secure server endpoint after authentication.
This ensures that the role data is valid and trusted.

1. Create an Endpoint to Fetch User Role on the Server.
In you Spring Boot application, you should have an endpoint that returns the authenticated user's role.
Ensure this endpoint is protected, and only accessible to authenticated user.
