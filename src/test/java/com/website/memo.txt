To create a test case that commits real data to the database for testing purpose (using a dummy dataset),
you will need to configure your test envirionment use a real database.
This is typically done with test-specific dadtabase setup,
such as using an in-memory database or a dedicated test database that is separate from your production data.

steps to create a real data test case.

configure a tes database use an in-memory database like h2 or a dedicated test database.
set up test configureation: use pring boot's testing frame work to configure adifferent set of perpeti for tests.
write a test acse: create a junit test that performs actual data insertion using the controller.
use a test profile. ensure that the test runs with the appropriate profile to avoid affecting production data.
